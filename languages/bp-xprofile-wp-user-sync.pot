#. Description of the plugin/theme
msgid "Map BuddyPress xProfile fields to WordPress User fields. <strong>Note:</strong> because there is no way to hide xProfile fields, all field definitions are deleted when it is deactivated. The plugin tries to reconnect on reactivation, but always backup before deactivating. <strong>The best way to update this plugin is to replace the folder with the latest version via FTP or similar. This avoids the deactivate-reactivate process.</strong>"
