BP XProfile WordPress User Sync
===============================

The *BP XProfile WordPress User Sync* plugin is useful when you have a BuddyPress network in which you want users to enter values for *First Name* and *Last Name* rather than rely on the more freeform default *Name* field that BuddyPress provides.

The plugin replaces the default BuddyPress XProfile *Name* field with two fields called (surprisingly) *First Name* and *Last Name*. These field values are kept in sync with the corresponding WordPress user profile fields as well as the BuddyPress XProfile *Name* field itself.
