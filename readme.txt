Replaces the default BuddyPress xProfile Name field with First Name and Last Name fields and keeps these in sync with WordPress user profile fields.



== Description ==

The BP xProfile WordPress User Sync plugin is useful when you have a BuddyPress network in which you want to make sure that users enter values for First Name and Last Name rather than rely on the more freeform default Name field that BuddyPress provides.

The plugin replaces the default BuddyPress xProfile Name field with two fields called (surprisingly) First Name and Last Name. These field values are kept in sync with the corresponding WordPress user profile fields as well as the BuddyPress xProfile Name field itself.

### Plugin Updates

**The best way to update this plugin is to replace the folder with the latest version via FTP or similar. This avoids the deactivate-reactivate process.**

### Plugin Deactivation

**Please note:** because there is no way to hide xProfile fields, all field definitions associated with this plugin are deleted when it is deactivated. The field data itself is not deleted and the plugin makes an attempt to reconnect the existing data to the new field definitions when it is reactivated. **Always back up your database before deactivating this plugin.**

When upgrading this plugin, it's best to simply replace the plugin directory directly. This is preferable to using the WordPress updater because it avoids the deactivate-activate process.
